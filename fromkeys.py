# Imagine we're creating a video game and want to model the initial starting-state of our game.  I've provided you with a list of strings called game_properties.

# Use dict.fromkeys  to generate a new dictionary using the provided game_properties  list.  Initialize all values to 0 .  

# Save the result in a variable called initial_game_state 

game_properties = ["current_score", "high_score", "number_of_lives", "items_in_inventory", "power_ups", "ammo", "enemies_on_screen", "enemy_kills", "enemy_kill_streaks", "minutes_played", "notifications", "achievements"] 

# Use the game_properties list and dict.fromkeys() to generate a dictionary with all values set to 0. Save the result to a variable called initial_game_state
initial_game_state = dict.fromkeys(game_properties, 0)
print(initial_game_state)
